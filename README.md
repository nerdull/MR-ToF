# Multireflection Time-of-Flight Mass Spectrometer

This repository is part of an ERC project (_NEXT_, PI: J. Even) for the mass spectrometry of superheavy nuclei at the University of Groningen.
It collects all relevant files for the ion dynamics simulations at low energies with [SIMION](https://simion.com/).

## Prerequisite
The development environment is **SIMION 8.1.2.30-TEST-2017-02-01**.

## Usage
1. Load the ion workbench (`next.iob`) to SIMION.
1. Run the simulation by clicking on "Fly'm".
1. Upon completion of the simulation, exit SIMION but do _NOT_ save changes to `next.iob`. This is to ensure a clean start for the next round.
