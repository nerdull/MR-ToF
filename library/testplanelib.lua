-- testplanelib.lua
-- Utility routines for defining and recording data on additional test
-- planes.
--
-- This can be more flexible that the "Crossing Plane" option in
-- SIMION Data Recording.  Here you can define multiple test planes,
-- even test planes non-orthogonal to the axes.
--
-- By default, this generates "markers" when particles reach test
-- planes.  SIMION Data Recording can be configured to record data
-- when markers occur ("All Markers").  Alternately you can define
-- your own "action" function to execute when particles hit the test
-- plane.
--
-- SIMION segments only get executed when particles are inside
-- potential array instances.  Therefore, these test planes will not
-- get triggered when particles are outside array instances.  If that
-- is a problem, add to your workbench a large PA instance of low
-- priority in the PA instance order (PAs tab) to cover the region in
-- which test planes should be triggered.

end

-- Creates test plane definition.
-- Test plane contains point (p0_x,p0_y,p0_z) and normal vector
-- (pn_x,pn_y,pn_z).  Normal vector need not be normalized.
--
-- Returns a table containing these fields:
--
--   time_to_plane
--     This is a function (x,y,z, vx,vy,vz) --> t that returns
--     time t (microseconds) for particle at position (x,y,z) (mm)
--     traveling with velocity (vx,vy,vz) to reach the test plane,
--     assuming constant velocity.  t will be negative if particle
--     is traveling away from test plane or +-infinity if traveling
--     exactly parallel to test plane.
--
--   tstep_adjust
--     SIMION tstep_adjust segment that can be used to reduce
--     time-steps when particles approach test planes (binary boundary
--     approach).  This ensures that test plane measurements are precisely
--     on the test plane.
--
--   other_actions
--     SIMION other_actions segment that calls action() when particles
--     reach the test plane.  If action is nil, then the mark() (generate
--     marker) function is used.
--
-- tstep_adjust and other_actions must both be used since they
-- depend on each other in this implementation.
--
-- To use, markers, enable record when "All Markers" in Data Recording.
--
-- This supports both Grouped ("Particles|Grouped" enabled) and
-- non-Grouped flying.  However, markers might not work properly for
-- grouped flying since the mark() command marks *all* currently
-- flying particles, even if just one of those is currently at the
-- test plane.
